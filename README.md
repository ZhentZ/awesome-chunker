# Awesome-Chunker

ğŸš€ğŸš€ğŸš€This project aims to gather and synthesize diverse text chunking methods for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task, including but not limited to academic papers, algorithm interpretations, and code implementations.

ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡The goal of the project is to provide researchers with a comprehensive repository of resources to support their ability to more access easily and understand various text chunking techniques when developing and optimizing RAG-based AI systems.
